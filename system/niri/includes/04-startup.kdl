// Add lines like this to spawn processes at startup.
// Note that running niri as a session supports xdg-desktop-autostart,
// which may be more convenient to use.
// See the binds section below for more spawn examples.
 
// This line starts waybar, a commonly used bar for Wayland compositors.
 
// To run a shell command (with variables, pipes, etc.), use spawn-sh-at-startup:
// spawn-sh-at-startup "qs -c ~/source/qs/MyAwesomeShell"
