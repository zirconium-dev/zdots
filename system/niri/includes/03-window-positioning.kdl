    // By default focus ring and border are rendered as a solid background rectangle
    // behind windows. That is, they will show up through semitransparent windows.
    // This is because windows using client-side decorations can have an arbitrary shape.
    //
    // If you don't like that, you should uncomment `prefer-no-csd` below.
    // Niri will draw focus ring and border *around* windows that agree to omit their
    // client-side decorations.
    //
    // Alternatively, you can override it with a window rule called
    // `draw-border-with-background`.
 
 
    // You can enable drop shadows for windows.

        // Note that niri has no way of knowing about the CSD window corner
        // radius. It has to assume that windows have square corners, leading to
        // shadow artifacts inside the CSD rounded corners. This setting fixes
        // those artifacts.
        //
        // However, instead you may want to set prefer-no-csd and/or
        // geometry-corner-radius. Then, niri will know the corner radius and
        // draw the shadow correctly, without having to draw it behind the
        // window. These will also remove client-side shadows if the window
        // draws any.

        // draw-behind-window true
 
        // You can change how shadows look. The values below are in logical

    // You can think of them as a kind of outer gaps. They are set in logical pixels.

    // Top and bottom struts will simply add outer gaps in addition to the area occupied by
    // layer-shell panels and regular gaps.
